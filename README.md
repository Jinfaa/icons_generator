# Swift Icon Generator for iOS and Android

This Swift script automates the generation of application icons for both iOS and Android platforms using a single source image. It also supports the creation of alternative icons for iOS and updates the `Info.plist` file accordingly.

## Features

* üì± **Android Icon Generation**

  * Standard launcher icons for all screen densities: `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, `xxhdpi`, `xxxhdpi`
  * Round icons and adaptive icons (foreground only)
  * Play Store icon (512x512)

* üçè **iOS Icon Generation**

  * Creates all required icons for iPhone, iPad, Spotlight, Settings, Notification, and App Store
  * Automatically generates `Contents.json` for use with Xcode asset catalogs

* üé® **Alternative Icons Support**

  * Processes PNGs from `assets/app_icons/alts/`
  * Generates 2x (120x120) and 3x (180x180) icons
  * Updates `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to register alternative icons

* üõ† **Automation and Utility Features**

  * Verifies that the source image file exists
  * Logs a warning if the source image appears to be smaller than recommended
  * Creates necessary directories before saving output
  * Uses `sips` for high-quality resizing

## Requirements

* macOS with `sips` installed (default on macOS)
* Swift (run via `swift icon_generator.swift`)

## Usage

1. Place your source icon at:

   ```
   [root_directory]/assets/app_icons/logo.png
   ```

   Ensure it is at least **1024x1024** pixels for best results.

2. Optional: Place alternative icons (1024x1024 PNG) in:

   ```
   [root_directory]/assets/app_icons/alts/
   ```

3. Run the script from your project's root or specify the root directory:

   ```bash
   # If running from the project root (e.g., where 'ios' and 'android' folders are)
   swift Utilities/icons_generator/generate_app_icons.swift
   
   # Or specify the project root directory as an argument
   swift Utilities/icons_generator/generate_app_icons.swift /path/to/your/project
   
   # Use '.' for the current directory explicitly
   swift Utilities/icons_generator/generate_app_icons.swift .
   ```
   The script defaults to the current directory if no path is provided.
   You can also use `swift Utilities/icons_generator/generate_app_icons.swift --help` for usage instructions.

## Output

* **Android icons**: `[root_directory]/android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`
* **iOS icons**: `[root_directory]/ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
* **Alternative icons**: `[root_directory]/ios/Runner/App Icons/`

## Notes

* The script performs a basic check to ensure the source image exists.
* It also attempts to detect if the image might be too small by checking for common resolutions like 1024 or 2048 in the `sips` output, but this is not a strict validation.
* It creates any missing directories automatically.
* Uses `sips` for resizing to preserve transparency and image quality.
